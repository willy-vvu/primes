#Introduction
2-3 Pages
Problem: too many assignments
- Importance of moocs
- Stress importance with _real_ numbers
- Moocs are important, then what?

It's hard to grade assigments from thousands of people 
- Debate on automated grading
- Debate on peer grading

One thing missing:
- *A real attempt on solution based on math and game theory.*
- Not that everything is provable, but
- Designing systems with proofs in mind -> good systems in practice
- Give examples of those systems

Address question "How to prove such a system?"
  - Field of economics: game theory
  - Models human behavior well enough to predict it

We are central designer w/ goal that everyone's papers get graded
  - We will use tools+models from game theory to model human behavior
  - End goal -> Become mathematically provable
  - Somehow design system to incentivise selfish people to accurately grade papers of others

# Toy examples
Just to give taste of how to go about thinking about these problems

1. Give everyone papers to grade.
Get back garbage.

2. Two people grade everyone's paper. Bonus points if both agree.
   Smart student -> give everyone 100.

3. Finish w/ brief summary with results
   Small informal statement that describes the system with a claim.
   "Our system asks two people"

Provide some theorem: Can't do something super simple. You have to do something clever to account for everything.

Acknoledge the questions

"This is interesting future research question"

Write the above really well for next week.
Introduction makes or breaks a paper.
